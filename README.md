# Mitigating Bias in AI: Detection Techniques and Solutions

This project addresses one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî **bias in machine learning models**. It presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of various bias detection and mitigation algorithms and delivers a practical solution for ensuring fairness in AI systems.

## üìò Abstract

Biases in machine learning models have led to unfair decisions in critical areas such as finance, justice, and employment, thereby undermining public trust in AI systems. Despite the development of numerous bias mitigation algorithms, there has been a lack of comprehensive comparative analyses to guide their selection and application. This project was driven by the need to understand the effectiveness of these algorithms and to provide a practical tool for identifying and addressing biases, performing reduction, and promoting fairer and more trustworthy AI systems.
This project involved a thorough comparison of various bias detection and mitigation techniques to address the issue of bias in AI models. Initially, we implemented a range of methods to identify the most effective detection techniques. Following this, diverse mitigation strategies were applied to reduce or eliminate the detected biases. Each technique was evaluated using widely recognized fairness metrics to assess its effectiveness in different contexts. The results were analyzed to identify the most promising approaches for different types of biases and application scenarios.
Based on these findings, we developed a strategy that integrates the best techniques applicable to corresponding datasets. The final outcomes offer actionable insights and practical strategies for developing fairer AI systems that can be widely adopted in various fields. The results of this project benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including AI practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and organizations deploying AI systems. By providing practical solutions for bias management in machine learning models, this project advances AI practices and enhances the fairness and trustworthiness of AI systems.
Ultimately, this work contributes to the broader goal of ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that are equitable across all aspects of AI applications. Through these efforts, the project envisions a future where AI systems uphold standards and foster public confidence in their applications.
